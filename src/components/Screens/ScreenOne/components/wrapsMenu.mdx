# Screen 1: Wraps Menu

This menu is largely static and is used to display common sandwiches along with their description, price and calories. This area is primarily constructed using the Subline Item common component.

Though the menu itself does not animate per se, it does cycle through and highlight sanwich options in yellow, while also cycling through the matching image of said sandwich. These
items can be modified within this component.
