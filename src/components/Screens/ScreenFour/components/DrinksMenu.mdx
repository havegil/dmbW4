# Screen 4: Drinks Menu

This area is largely static and is used to display the cold and hot drinks menu. The top half also displays an add on section for chips, cookies, and drinks. 
The bottom of the panel cycles through whatever drink sizes the restaraunt has set to be available and rotates between cold and hot drinks.
