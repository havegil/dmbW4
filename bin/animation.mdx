# Animation Tips

## Setting up your component for animation

In order to animate components with [gsap](https://greensock.com/docs/), the style for each animated element should be set as follows:
```
#parent-element {
    img {
        position: absolute;
        top: 0;
        left: 0;
    }
}

```
This should ensure that elements act consistenly  and can be easily animated.

When animating, all animation should go in the "ComponentDidMount" function. Here is a simple example that also shows how to use nodes in order to refrence the components for animation.

```
export default class TurkeyBaconGuac extends Component {

    componentDidMount() {
        let timeline = new TimelineMax();

        timeline
        .set([this.Frame2, this.Frame2Text, this.Frame3, this.Frame3Text, this.Legal], {autoAlpha: 0})
        .set(this.Frame3, {left: -200})

        .to([this.Frame2, this.Frame2Text], 0.5, {autoAlpha: 1}, "+=3")
        .to(this.Callout, 0, {autoAlpha: 0})
        .to(this.Frame2, 4.5, {left: -200, ease:Linear.easeNone}, "-=0.5")
        .to([this.Frame3, this.Frame3Text], 0.5, {autoAlpha: 1}, "-=0.5")
        .to(this.Frame3, 4.5, {left: 0, ease:Linear.easeNone}, "-=0.5")
        .to([this.Frame2, this.Frame2Text, this.Frame3, this.Frame3Text], 0.5, {autoAlpha: 0}, "-=0.5")
        .to([this.Callout, this.Legal], 1, {autoAlpha: 1}, "+=0.5")
    }

    render() {
    return (
        <div className="turkey-bacon-guac-quad">
            <img src={FinalFrame} ref={(node) => this.FinalFrame = node} />
            <img src={Callout} ref= {(node) => this.Callout = node} />
            <img src={Frame2} ref={(node) => this.Frame2 = node } />
            <img src={Frame2Text} ref={(node) => this.Frame2Text = node } />
            <img src={Frame3} ref={(node) => this.Frame3 = node } />
            <img src={Frame3Text} ref={(node) => this.Frame3Text = node } />
            <img src={Border} ref={(node) => this.Border = node } />
            <img src={Legal} ref={(node) => this.Legal = node } />
        </div>
    )
    }
}
```

## General tips

* Try not to animate too many elements simultaneously. Due to performance issues, this will likely cause the animation to stutter.

* When animating with gsap, use "top" and "left" as opposed to "x" and "y" to animate movement. This also helps to reduce stuttering.

* When possible, avoid large scale zooming. Instead, try fading between the zoomed in and not zoomed in frames.

* Most of the time, things that move too quickly wil stutter. If this happens, try experimenting with the animation speed.

* Though rare, "L2R" vs "R2L" screen setups can affect certain elements of your animation. If this happens, additional styling may be necessary to ensure that elements dont look broken.

* Dual screen versions of the animation must ONLY use the "autoAlpha" (opacity) command for animation. Due to performance concerns, this is the only way dual screen setups can function with minimal issue.

* For simple animations, instead of creating HTML for each individual element, the [DOMinator](/components/common/DOMinator) can be used to quickly set up the DOM
