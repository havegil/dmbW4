# Pushing to the Boards

When you want to either push a new build to the boards, or update the current build:

```
yarn push
```

<br/>

### Enter your filename

If creating a new build, you can just press "enter" here and use the default filename.
<br/>

### Do you want to create new .mht content, or update existing content on the player?
```
New
Update
```

New will create an entirely new build of the boards, while Update will modify the existing build.

<br/>

### Update quad or dual player?
```
quad
dual
```
You will almost always want to pick "quad" here as that is how the boards are typically tested.
<br/>


### Do you want to *force* display what's in local-data.json as opposed to what is in Director?
```
Y/n
```
If you are testing with hard coded data from local-data.js, pick Y.

Otherwise, if you are testing the boards with dynaic data from  neocast, choose n.
<br/>

### Enter the password for the player
```
upshot
```
<br />

A new build will now be created or updated, and can be viewed in Director.
