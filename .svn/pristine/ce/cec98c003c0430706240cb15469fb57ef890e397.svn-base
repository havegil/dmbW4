## Setting price or other variable data

At the top of your file, import the API
```
import API from 'api';
```

Then within your component set the value using a variable. For example:
```
let itemPrice = `$${API.loc('your_price_key_goes_here')}`
```
You can verify this is working by setting this key to the desired value in
```
src/neocast/local-data.js
```
Note: This key should be the one provided by the project manager.
